# project-competition-
This project was purely made for a competition in my university, more on that in README

The competition is about making the best website in 4 weeks using languages learned on a course, which are HTML CSS JavaScript.
The website is required to have a homepage, contact us, about me sections, with that it's required to have 3 more pages about the topic of the website made.
There arent any rules for the topic, overall it can be anything.
One of the other requirements is having a teammate, if you don't have one like a friend, they'll give you a random teammate, I don't have anyone so they gave me a random teammate, I haven't mentioned his name as credit because he is unresponsive, I've been contacting him since Thursday.
