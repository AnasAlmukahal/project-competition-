# project-competition-
this project was purely made for a competition in my university, more on that in README

the competition is about making the best website in 4 weeks using languages learned on a course, which are HTML CSS JavaScript.
the website is required to have a homepage, contact us, about me sections, with that it's required to have 3 more pages about the topic of the website made.
there arent any rules for the topic, overall it can be anything.
